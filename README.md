# aravoxel-bevy
The Bevy flavor of `aravoxel`. It's mostly me experimenting.

`aravoxel` is a procedurally generated voxel world. It's my personal playground for testing and learning more
about procedural generation and voxel game development.

`aravoxel` is not really aiming to be the fastest and most optimized solution out there. I do things my way and
learn as I go. The entire idea is to not use existing libraries and make my own mesh building and chunk generation.
